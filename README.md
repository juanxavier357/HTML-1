## Overview

**The challenge**

Users should be able to:

* Ver el diseÃ±o Ã³ptimo segÃºn el tamaÃ±o de pantalla de su dispositivo

**Screenshot**


Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

**Built with**
* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

**What I learned**
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out The Markdown Guide to learn more.

**Continued development**
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Useful resources**
+ Example resource 1 - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
* Example resource 2 - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
